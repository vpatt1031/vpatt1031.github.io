                                        Vanessa Patterson is a graduate of Virginia Commonwealth University with a Bachelor of Science in Biology. Since graduating from VCU, Vanessa has spent her time living in different cities while starting a family. In the past ten years she has lived in Richmond, Fayetteville, Hawaii, and northern Virginia.

                                        Vanessa began her career in STEM as and undergraduate working at the Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services in Richmond. She assisted scientists in the Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis Department as a Laboratory Specialists. Vanessa left that position in order to relocate to North Carolina, where her husband was stationed at the time with the U.S. Army. After spending a couple of years at home to start a family, Vanessa re-entered the workforce working as an Admissions Advisor at the Education Centers located at the various military bases in Hawaii.

                                        Upon moving to Virginia, Vanessa provided administrative support to a private K-8 school in Annandale. It was in this role that Vanessa became acquainted with using web applications such as WordPress and Blackboard Web Community Manager. Designing web pages through these applications created an interest in Vanessa to learn more about a career in web development. Since enrolling in the Full-Stack Developer Coding Bootcamp offered through the University of Richmond, Vanessa has enjoyed the creative process of designing web pages from scratch, and hopes to break into the industry of Web Development upon completing the program.
