                <p>
                    Vanessa Patterson is a graduate of Virginia Commonwealth University with a Bachelor of
                    Science in Biology. Since graduating from VCU, Vanessa has spent her time living in
                    different cities while starting a family. In the past ten years she has lived in Richmond,
                    Fayetteville, Hawaii, and northern Virginia. Currently she resides in Charlotte, NC to be
                    near family during the pandemic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vanessa began her career in STEM as an undergraduate working at the Division of
                    Consolidated Laboratory Services in Richmond. She assisted scientists in the Pulse Field Gel
                    Electrophoresis Department as a Laboratory Specialist. Vanessa left that position in order
                    to relocate to North Carolina, where her husband was stationed at the time with the U.S.
                    Army. After spending a couple of years at home to start a family, Vanessa re-entered the
                    workforce working as a college admissions advisor for the education centers located at the various
                    military bases in Hawaii.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon moving to Virginia, Vanessa provided administrative support to a private K-8 school in
                    Annandale. It was in that role that Vanessa became acquainted with using web applications
                    such as WordPress and Blackboard Web Community Manager. Designing web pages through these
                    applications developed an interest in Vanessa to learn more about a career in web development.
                    Since enrolling in the Full-Stack Developer Coding Bootcamp offered through the University
                    of Richmond, Vanessa has enjoyed the creative process of designing web pages from scratch,
                    and hopes to break into the industry of Web Development upon completing the program.
